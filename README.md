pi-ldp
------

This is a simple library for interacting with the
[LDP-8008](http://www.embeddedadventures.com/LED_matrix_display_LDP-8008.html).

It is a C port of the Python version located [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=67520&p=493326).

Currently, we can fire some bits at the LCD and have them display.

TODO
----

Plenty...

* Implement displaying of static messages
* Implement scrolling
* Add ability to just blast an 80x8 array to the LCD
* Add PWM to EN for brightness control
* Implement better scrolling, with speed control and stuff
